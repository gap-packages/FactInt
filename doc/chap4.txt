  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YTimings for the general factorization routine[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  few  words  in  advance: In general, it is not possible to give a precise
  prediction  for the CPU time needed for factoring a given integer. This time
  depends  heavily on the sizes of the factors of the given number and on some
  other   properties   which  cannot  be  tested  before  actually  doing  the
  factorization.  But  nevertheless, rough run time estimates can be given for
  numbers with factors of given orders of magnitude.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  casting out the small and other [21Xeasy[121X factors -- which should not take
  more  than  at  most  a  few  minutes  for numbers of [21Xreasonable[121X size -- the
  general  factorization  routine  uses first ECM (see [2XFactorsECM[102X ([14X3.4-1[114X)) for
  finding factors very roughly up to the third root of the remaining composite
  and  then the MPQS (see [2XFactorsMPQS[102X ([14X3.6-1[114X)) for doing the [21Xrest[121X of the work.
  The latter is often the most time-consuming part.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  sequel,  some timings for the ECM and for the MPQS are given. These
  methods  are  by  far  the  most  important  ones  with  respect to run time
  statistics  (the [22Xp ± 1[122X-methods (see [2XFactorsPminus1[102X ([14X3.2-1[114X) and [2XFactorsPplus1[102X
  ([14X3.3-1[114X))  are  only suitable for finding factors with certain properties and
  CFRAC  (see [2XFactorsCFRAC[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X)) is just a slower predecessor of the MPQS).
  All  absolute  timings  are  given  for  a  Pentium 200  under  Windows as a
  reference  machine (this was a fast machine at the time the first version of
  this package has been written).[133X
  
  
  [1X4.2 [33X[0;0YTimings for the ECM[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  run time of [10XFactorsECM[110X depends mainly on the size of the factors of the
  input  number.  On  average, finding a 12-digit factor of a 100-digit number
  takes  about  1 min 40 s,  finding  a  15-digit factor of a 100-digit number
  takes  about  10 min  and  finding  an 18-digit factor of a 100-digit number
  takes about 50 min. A general rule of thumb is the following: one digit more
  increases the run time by a bit less than a factor of two. These timings are
  very  rough,  and  they  may vary by a factor of 10 or more. You can compare
  trying  an  elliptic  curve  with throwing a couple of dice, where a success
  corresponds  to  the  case  where  all  of  them show the same side -- it is
  possible to be successful with the first trial, but it is also possible that
  this  takes  much  longer.  In particular, all trials are independent of one
  another.  In  general,  ECM is superior to Pollard's Rho for finding factors
  with  at  least  10 decimal digits. In the same time needed by Pollard's Rho
  for  finding  a 13-digit factor one can reasonably expect to find a 17-digit
  factor  when using ECM, for which Pollard's Rho in turn would need about 100
  times as long as ECM. For larger factors this difference grows rapidly. From
  theory  it  can  be  said  that finding a 20-digit factor requires about 500
  times  as  much work as finding a 10-digit factor, finding a 30-digit factor
  requires  about  160  times  as  much  work as finding a 20-digit factor and
  finding  a 40-digit factor requires about 80 times as much work as finding a
  30-digit factor.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe default parameters are optimized for finding factors with about 15 -- 35
  digits. This seems to be a sensible choice, since this is the most important
  range  for  the application of ECM. The function [10XFactorsECM[110X usually gives up
  when the input number [22Xn[122X has two factors which are both larger than its third
  root.  This  is  of  course only a [21Xprobabilistic[121X statement. Sometimes -- but
  seldom  --  the  remaining  composite  has 3 factors, 4 factors should occur
  (almost) never.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  user  can of course specify other parameters than the default ones, but
  giving  timings  for  all  possible  choices  is  obviously  impossible. The
  interested  reader should follow the references given in the bibliography at
  the end of this manual for getting information on how many curves with which
  parameters  are  usually  needed  for  finding factors of a given size. This
  depends  mainly  on the distribution of primes, respectively of numbers with
  prime factors not exceeding a certain bound.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  benchmarking  purposes,  the  amount of time needed for trying a single
  curve  with  given  smoothness  bounds  for a number of given size is suited
  best.  A  typical example is the following: one curve with ([3XLimit1[103X,[3XLimit2[103X) =
  (100000,10000000)  applied  to  a  100-digit  integer  requires  a  total of
  10 min 20 s,  where  6 min 45 s are spent for the first stage and 3 min 35 s
  are  spent  for  the  second  stage.  The time needed for the first stage is
  approximately linear in [3XLimit1[103X and the time needed for the second stage is a
  bit less than linear in [3XLimit2[103X.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.3 [33X[0;0YTimings for the MPQS[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  run  time  of [10XFactorsMPQS[110X depends only on the size of the input number,
  and not on the size of its factors. Rough timings are as follows: 90 s for a
  40-digit  number,  10 min  for a 50-digit number, 2 h for a 60-digit number,
  20 h  for  a  70-digit number and 100 h for a 75-digit number. These timings
  are  much more precise than those given for ECM, but they may also vary by a
  factor  of  2  or 3  depending  on  whether  a good factor base can be found
  without  using  a  large  multiplier  or not. A general rule of thumb is the
  following:  10 digits  more  cause  10 times  as much work. For benchmarking
  purposes,  precise  timings  for  some integers are given: [22X38!+1[122X (45 digits,
  good  factor  base  with multiplier 1): 2 min 22 s, [22X40!-1[122X (48 digits, not so
  good  factor base even with multiplier 7): 8 min 58 s, cofactor of [22X1093^33+1[122X
  (61 digits, good factor base with multiplier 1): 1 h 12 min.[133X
