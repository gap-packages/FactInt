                           -- A GAP 4 Package --

                               Version 1.6.0

         Author and Maintainer:  Stefan Kohl, stefan@gap-system.org


                                  Abstract

FactInt is a GAP 4 package which provides routines for factoring integers, in
particular:

 - Pollard's p-1
 - Williams' p+1
 - Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
 - Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
 - Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)

It also provides access to  Richard P. Brent's tables  of factors of integers
of the form b^k +/- 1.
   FactInt installs a better method for the operation `Factors' for integers.
For details see the package documentation in the `doc' subdirectory -- either
view  its  HTML  version  (chap0.html)  with  a browser,  or its  PDF version
`manual.pdf' with a PDF viewer.


                                Requirements

This Version of FactInt needs at least  GAP >=4.8.8  and GAPDoc >=1.6.  It is
completely written in the  GAP language and does neither contain  nor require
external binaries.


                                Installation

Like any other GAP package,  FactInt must be installed in the  pkg/ subdirec-
tory of the GAP distribution.  This is accomplished by extracting the distri-
bution file in this directory. By default, FactInt is autoloaded.  This means
that it is loaded automatically when you start GAP.


                          Distribution and Updates

This package is distributed  with the main  GAP archive.  For updates between
releases of GAP itself check the package web page

      https://stefan-kohl.github.io/factint.html

or the packages' redistribution on the GAP website
